## 🚀 Current Project: **Anhelina**
📸 *“A picture is worth a thousand insights.”*  
Anhelina lets users take a photo of a property (e.g. a rental), and instantly see everything the landlord wants them to know — from rent to amenities, and more. It’s a beautiful, intuitive app bridging real-world visuals with practical information.
